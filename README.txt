### NYC Moves

Neighborhood geoJSON file from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhq/data.

###### TODO
- add number of passengers to calculations
- slider for times
- tooltip on hover over each neighborhood
- track total # ppl in transit (and thus not on the map)

##### Dependencies
Install the python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The shapely package requires the GEOS library, which can be installed via brew, apt-get, yum, or the [official website](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/).
